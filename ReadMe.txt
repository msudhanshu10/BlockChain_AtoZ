This project is done as a part of Blockchain A to Z masterclass MOOC by Udemy.
Three parts to the project:
1- 	Building a blockchain in python. 
	Mined blocks if proof of work is 4 leading zeros. 
	Used SHA256 as a hashing function. 
	Created three ports for running the application in 3 consoles to make the application decentralized.

2-	Building a cryptocurrency and transactions facilities on top of blockchain built in part 1.

3- 	Creating a smart contract in Solidity for the transaction of the cryptocurrency built in part 2. The smart contract is deployed on MyEthereumWallet using Ganache.

Key Terminologies/Technologies:
Solidity, Python, Smart Contract, Ethereum, Ganache, Blockchain, Postman, Flask.
